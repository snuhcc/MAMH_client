The movie I want to introduce today is \"The Island,\" a 2005 film set in a future where human cloning is rampant.

How does this movie incorporate the theme of cloning? Let\'s dive in and find out.

The story begins with a man waking from a nightmare. This man is Lincoln-6 Echo, known simply as Echo. He lives in a secluded facility where his health is constantly monitored. As he steps outside, he sees many people dressed exactly like him, moving to unknown destinations.

A lottery is held to determine who will go to \"The Island.\" Meals are strictly controlled in the facility. We then meet the heroine of our story, Jordan-2 Delta, known as Delta. Echo, constantly monitored and controlled, is plagued by mysterious dreams of a ship and unending questions.

Unlike the others, Echo is full of curiosity. He learns that a pathway to The Island opens when a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth. They are told the outside world is contaminated by an unknown substance, but they have no idea why or how it is contaminated. One day, Echo finds a live insect in the supposedly contaminated area, hinting that the story about the contamination might be a lie.

An important scene suggests that the people in white clothing are actually clones. Echo meets Delta in a bar and shares his discovery. Another lottery takes place, and Delta wins, but Echo feels uneasy. To resolve his discomfort, Echo sneaks into the highly restricted Sector 3 during the night and witnesses a woman, who was supposed to go to The Island after giving birth, being killed right after delivering her baby.

Echo realizes they are just tools, and the initial person chosen to go to The Island was merely a sacrificial victim. This scene, where hope turns to despair, struck me as particularly brutal. Discovered by the authorities, Echo returns to the facility and urges Delta to escape with him. They flee, chased by pursuers, and eventually discover a shocking truth when they reach a wide-open space.

They manage to escape to the outside world. Meanwhile, Dr. Merrick, who oversees the facility, lies to people that the clones are merely unconscious products. He hires a special forces mercenary, Laurent, to capture Echo and Delta. On their journey, Echo and Delta find a bar and meet McCord, a friend. McCord reveals more shocking truths and helps them until he is killed by their pursuers.

Echo and Delta reach Los Angeles, where Delta sees her original self, lost in thought. Dr. Merrick, facing the collapse of everything he\'s built, becomes increasingly desperate. Michael Bay\'s trademark action sequences ensue, and Echo and Delta end up at the iconic Running Man logo. The action is intense and fast-paced, true to blockbuster form.

Dr. Merrick learns that the clones are developing defects and converses with another Echo clone. Echo and Delta head to the home of Echo\'s original, Tom Lincoln. Using Echo\'s retinal scan, they confirm it\'s Tom\'s house. While sneaking around the house, they are confronted by Tom Lincoln, Echo\'s original. They have a conversation while resting at Tom\'s house, a scene that felt very fresh at the time.

Tom Lincoln reveals his liver is failing but doesn\'t mention he needs Echo\'s liver. Ultimately, Lincoln reports the facility to the authorities. It\'s a reminder that nothing is more precious than one\'s own life. Lincoln and Echo face off against the pursuers, and Laurent begins to confuse Echo with Lincoln. Echo tricks Laurent by placing his bracelet on Lincoln, leading to Lincoln\'s death.

Echo hears about the recall of the clones and heads to the facility disguised as Lincoln, with Delta also successfully infiltrating. Laurent, feeling conflicted about seeing the living clones, experiences a change of heart. The facility realizes the body they autopsied isn\'t Echo. The final showdown between Echo and Dr. Merrick unfolds, with Echo cleverly killing Merrick at a critical moment.

All the clones emerge into the outside world, and the movie ends on a hopeful note. Will they find the true Island? In this film, the Island represents both a symbol of hope and a symbol of death. To the clones, it is a land of hope, but in reality, it is a path to death, leading to the protagonists\' despair.

In the end, Scarlett Johansson\'s character says, \"This place we\'re in together is the real Island.\" The protagonists find hope amid despair and claim their place by their own strength.

Watching this movie, the theme of cloning didn\'t feel out of place. Will our society ever face such a future?

This has been a look at \"The Island.\"
