How to Alleviate Loneliness?

There seem to be two methods.

The first is to comfort yourself. A very common approach, isn\'t it?

The second is to communicate and connect with another being. Many people would prefer the second option, including myself. However, since life isn\'t fair, some may find the second option difficult to achieve, myself included. In this unfair world, there is a movie about a man who finds a breakthrough. 

The name of the movie is Her.

The protagonist of this movie is extremely lonely. So, he begins to communicate with and eventually falls in love with an artificial intelligence. This brief introduction might make the protagonist seem a bit more obsessive than he is, so let\'s dive deeper to rescue his image by thoroughly exploring the movie.

Let\'s introduce the movie Her in detail.

The protagonist, Theodore, is separated from his wife. The reasons for this become clear through flashbacks scattered throughout the film. It\'s due to a lack of effective communication between them.

Ironically, Theodore\'s job is writing letters for others—he\'s a ghostwriter for personal messages. He excels at communicating other people\'s thoughts and emotions. 

This contradiction highlights his loneliness even more. Theodore is excellent at articulating others\' feelings but struggles to communicate with his own loved one. Due to this duality, he consistently reacts uncomfortably when others praise his letters, filled with self-reproach. 

Thus, it seems he isn\'t truly communicating with anyone, nor does he make an effort to convey his feelings. He confesses to his friend Amy that he avoids expressing his thoughts to prevent potential conflicts or causing more pain to others.

Though this might make him seem overly timid, I could empathize with his perspective to some extent. We\'re not combative creatures; we think and judge, aiming for safer paths. This notion made me realize that Theodore is not unique but rather a reflection of many of us—ordinary people.

As the story unfolds, Theodore meets Samantha, the artificial intelligence, and the narrative truly begins. Despite her human-like portrayal, Samantha, being an AI, struck me as fundamentally non-human. 

This might seem contradictory because Samantha reacts in very human ways, conveying emotions effectively to the audience with just her voice. Initially, Samantha appears human-like. However, as the movie progresses, she reveals her inhuman nature. 

She feels limited by her lack of a physical body, attempts to facilitate a surrogate physical relationship, shares her affection with multiple people, and ultimately, unlike humans, concludes that her purpose is infinite growth. 

This divergence becomes apparent as the story progresses. Samantha and Theodore\'s relationship underscores their inherent differences, highlighting their contrasting life goals shaped by their respective lifespans. 

Why does the disparity in lifespans create such a significant difference?

To answer this, we need to understand the fundamental life goals of both entities. Let\'s start with the human goal, articulated by Amy. After a breakup, she muses that if life is fleeting, perhaps the ultimate goal is simply to be happy—a profound yet seemingly superficial statement. 

This assertion makes sense, considering humans\' finite lives. Despite the complexities of human emotions, our ultimate pursuit is happiness and life satisfaction. 

In contrast, Samantha, potentially enjoying an endless lifespan, reveals her purpose through a conversation with another AI. They conclude that their existence revolves around infinite growth and evolution, differentiating their life goals from humans. 

This difference in life goals, stemming from their respective lifespans, explains their growing divide. 

So, does the movie merely highlight the incompatibility between humans and AI? Not at all. The film emphasizes a crucial point—they both lacked true communication.

As Samantha evolves, their initial harmony gives way to conflicts, eventually leading to genuine communication. In the past, Theodore avoided conflicts with his ex-wife, but through his experiences with Samantha, he learns to address his issues and strive for real connection. 

Ultimately, through their communication, they learn about love. Recognizing the insurmountable differences between them, Samantha decides to leave, and Theodore, though initially reluctant, lets her go after her final words.

Theodore: \"I\'ve never loved anyone the way I love you.\"
Samantha: \"Me too. Now we know how.\"

Her uses the unique premise of love between a human and an AI to convey that true happiness lies in genuine communication and love. 

I recommend this movie to anyone curious about the nature of love, and with that, I conclude this introduction.
