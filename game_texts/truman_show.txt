Have you ever doubted your own life?

The reason I ask this seemingly pointless question is because of the movie I\'m introducing today.

The movie is called The Truman Show.

This film is about one man\'s life being broadcast live to the entire world without his knowledge.

Anyway, that\'s enough of the introduction. Now, let\'s dive into The Truman Show.

Here we have a man named Truman.

He has been the star of the world\'s most popular TV show, The Truman Show, for 10,909 days.

However, Truman is the only one who doesn\'t know this.

In other words, from the day he was born until his 10,909th day, he has no idea that he is on TV and that his entire life is a carefully crafted illusion.

The island of Seahaven, where he has lived since childhood, is an enormous, state-of-the-art set built just for him.

Another key aspect that keeps The Truman Show running is product placement.

Everything Truman uses and everything used by those around him is an advertisement.

Unaware of this hidden reality, Truman seems to live a satisfied and vibrant life.

But amidst his peaceful existence, Truman is secretly trying to find someone.

However, he is always told that the person doesn\'t exist.

Disappointed, Truman goes on a brief boat trip for work.

Yet, he soon returns home due to his trauma related to water.

Truman developed a fear of water after experiencing an incident where his father fell off a boat and disappeared.

Because of this trauma, Truman has a phobia of water and cannot bring himself to cross the sea.

Of course, this was also orchestrated by the producers to keep him from leaving Seahaven.

One day, as he begins another seemingly ordinary day, Truman unexpectedly reunites with someone he thought was deadâ€”his father.

As Truman, in a state of shock, tries to talk to his father, people suddenly appear, grab his father, and take him away on a bus.

Truman yells at the bus to stop, but it drives off.

Heart pounding, Truman explains everything to his mother, but she tries to convince him that he\'s mistaken.

Feeling deflated, Truman reminisces about his college days.

In college, he found himself inexplicably drawn to a woman.

He sensed that she also had feelings for him.

However, he found himself getting involved with the woman who would become his wife.

But fate has its ways, and Truman meets the mysterious woman again.

He learns that her name is Lauren Garland.

Truman tries to get closer to Lauren, but she warns him that they shouldn\'t be seen together and secretly hints to him.

Despite the warning, Truman persists, and Lauren, increasingly drawn to him, suddenly takes him to a deserted beach and tells him:

Lauren: \"Listen to me. They\'re all watching you. They\'re all pretending. Understand?\"

Lauren: \"What\'s he saying? It\'s all lies. Get out and find me.\"

Pushing aside these unsettling memories, Truman starts his day again.

But on his way to work, his radio malfunctions.

Radio: \"Turning left at Lancaster Square.\"

Realizing that something is very wrong, Truman starts acting unpredictably.

Growing more suspicious, Truman decides to leave for Fiji, a place he has always wanted to visit.

But the producers use various tactics to stop him (like a sudden bus breakdown or a fake radiation zone).

Caught in endless suspicion, Truman is brought back home.

Still unable to shake his doubts, the producers take drastic measures and reunite him with his supposedly dead father.

Overwhelmed by emotion, Truman appears to drop his suspicions and returns to his routine.

However, this was Truman\'s ploy. He even doubted the miracle of his father\'s return.

With Truman missing, the producers declare an emergency, and for the first time, The Truman Show is temporarily taken off the air.

The night set turns into day, and all the actors start searching for Truman.

When they can\'t find him, the show\'s producer, Christof, realizes that Truman is on a boat heading out to sea.

Everyone assumed he wouldn\'t venture to sea due to his fear of water.

Christof manipulates the weather to force Truman to turn back.

But Truman, defiant, shouts at the sky:

Truman: \"You\'ll have to kill me!\"

Ultimately, Truman discovers an emergency exit that leads to the outside world.

Seeing Truman\'s unyielding spirit, Christof speaks to him one last time:

Christof: \"There\'s no more truth out there than in the world I created for you.\"

After a moment of silence, Truman responds to the sky:

Truman: \"In case I don\'t see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night.\"

Truman takes his first step into the unknown world beyond, and the movie concludes.

In ancient Greece, a wise philosopher once claimed that behind every object lies the true essence of that object, known as the idea.

This philosopher was Plato, a figure synonymous with ancient Greek philosophy.

Today, let\'s consider Plato\'s Theory of Ideas as we analyze this film.

Without delving too deeply into complex philosophy, let\'s focus on aspects that relate to the movie.

Before we explore the Theory of Ideas, we must ask: What is this world? Why was I born?

Though these questions seem unanswerable, humans have pondered them for ages.

Plato reframed the question slightly: Why are we curious about the fundamental causes of the world?

He believed that our desire to live better drives this curiosity.

Plato then asked: What is truly worth contemplating?

The reason for this lengthy philosophical preamble isn\'t merely to state that Truman eventually found his own idea.

Perhaps Truman\'s life mirrors the Theory of Ideas in some ways.

But more importantly, we should focus on Truman\'s actions and choices.

Truman lives a seemingly satisfying life.

He appears to have no complaints, but a few incidents lead him to question his reality.

At this crossroads, he must decide whether to suppress his doubts and continue his life or delve deeper into his suspicions.

From an outsider\'s perspective, it seems obvious that he should question more, but the fear of the unknown is more daunting than it appears.

Nevertheless, Truman overcomes his trauma and persistently questions his reality.

To the viewer, his actions seem admirable and justified.

Why? Because we know his actions are meaningful.

Truman doesn\'t know this. Yet, he bravely faces challenges and discovers the truth.

In summary, we question the essence of things to understand what is true and valuable.

This intellectual pursuit stems from our desire to live better lives.

However, such thoughts and doubts can be exhausting and frightening.

Truman\'s journey to the real world, overcoming his fear of water, mirrors this struggle.

Watching Truman, we might ponder:

Is the path I\'m on truly valuable and right for me?

Is the life I believe in genuinely mine, or is it influenced by external factors?

Such doubts can be tiring and frightening.

Yet, by overcoming these challenges and persistently questioning, you might find a more valuable life, just as Truman did.

Conversely, you might discover that your path was right all along.

Ultimately, have you ever seriously doubted whether the life you\'re living is truly authentic?
