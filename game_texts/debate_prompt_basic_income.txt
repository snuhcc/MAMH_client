These topics aim to examine the diverse economic and social effects of introducing a basic income system from multiple perspectives, facilitating in-depth discussions and better-informed policy decisions.

The introduction of basic income could have various impacts on the labor market. Proponents argue that basic income provides economic stability, allowing individuals to choose jobs that match their skills and interests, thereby improving the quality of labor. Opponents, however, worry that basic income might reduce the motivation to work, leading to decreased productivity and economic inefficiency. This topic explores the positive and negative impacts of basic income on the labor market and how these effects can be managed.

A critical aspect of implementing basic income is how to fund it. Proponents suggest that revenue can be generated through wealth taxes or corporate taxes, which could also help reduce income inequality. Opponents argue that introducing basic income could undermine fiscal health and may not be sustainable in the long term. This topic discusses the methods of funding basic income and the economic impacts of these methods.

The impact of basic income on existing social welfare systems is a significant point of debate. Proponents believe that basic income can simplify the current welfare system, eliminate coverage gaps, and provide a basic living standard for all citizens. Opponents worry that if basic income replaces targeted welfare services, it may fail to meet the specific needs of certain groups. This topic examines the effects of basic income on social welfare and explores ways to enhance the social safety net through its implementation.
